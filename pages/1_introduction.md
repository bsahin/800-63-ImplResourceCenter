The NIST Trusted Identities Group (TIG) works with its partners to drive trust, convenience, and innovation in the Digital Identity marketplace by promoting government and commercial adoption of privacy enhancing, secure, interoperable, and easy-to-use solutions. Established in 2015, the TIG’s goal is to convene, facilitate, and catalyze a private sector-led approach to advance trusted digital identity solutions and to enable government adoption. To this end, the TIG continually evolves the risk-based federal guidance to encourage the adoption of innovative technologies in the market. 

In June 2017, NIST released an update to its Digital Identity Guidelines, in the form of NIST SP 800-63-3. This revision retired the concept of singular Levels of Assurance (LOAs), instead allowing for acknowledgment of the distinct components of digital identity assurance – identity proofing, authentication, and federation. The document was divided into four volumes, detailing the three identity assurance components as well as providing an overview of general identity frameworks and a risk-based process of selecting assurance levels. 

After the release of the revised guidelines, NIST received feedback indicating more information was necessary regarding implementation. In response to that feedback, NIST is producing implementation tools and resources, housed here in the Digital Identity Guidelines Resource Center, to assist agencies with transitioning to the new requirements outlined in NIST SP 800-63-3.  

This Resource Center is intended to provide agencies with useful resources and tools regarding 800-63-3 implementation. To provide feedback on existing resources, or to suggest your own use cases, please visit the Contribute page.
