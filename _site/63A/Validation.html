    <p>The goal of identity validation is to collect from the applicant the most appropriate identity evidence (for example, a passport or driver’s license) and determine its authenticity and accuracy. Regardless of identity assurance level, steps must be taken to validate the evidence to prevent an attacker from fraudulently completing the identity proofing process by presenting forged or modified evidence.</p>

<p>Identity validation is made up of two process steps: confirming the evidence is genuine and authentic, and confirming the data contained on the identity evidence is valid, current, and related to an actual, live individual.</p>

<p>At IAL 2, agencies may allow applicants to present evidence digitally to facilitate remote proofing. Evidence presented in this manner will often be examined visually to determine if it appears fraudulent, counterfeit, or otherwise modified. The collection of evidence and validation of their authenticity may occur at the same time. For example, if an applicant provides a digital image of their driver’s license, the system accepting that image may be able to automatically read the ID number or barcode and perform a lookup in the issuing state’s motor vehicles department to confirm its authenticity.</p>

<p>Agencies should also examine the evidence visually. Techniques for remote validation should be comparable to in-person validation. Table 5-2 in SP800-63A describe methods for validating identity evidence at each strength.</p>

<p>To determine whether the evidence is genuine, agencies should examine the security features of the provided evidence. These could be the physical or digital security features of a document or the cryptographically protected information contained within a physical document, or the cryptographically protected information within an electronic document. In each of these cases, methods such as the physical validation of the security features or electronic validation of the cryptographically protected content should be utilized to declare the evidence genuine or not. The table below provides examples of physical and digital security features.</p>

<p>To check if the identity evidence is valid, accuracy of the information such as that presented within the attributes should be confirmed with the issuing source, or machine-readable evidence such as passports or driver’s licenses should be automatically validated by equipment used by the agency.</p>
