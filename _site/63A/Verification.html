    <p>The goal of identity verification is to confirm and establish a linkage between the claimed identity and the physical, live existence of the person actually presenting the evidence. This can be done by a physical or biometric comparison, or a KBV challenge, or by authenticating the applicant with methods and credentials that are appropriate for the level of assurance.</p>

<p>The following table presents the verification methods that should be considered to achieve a given level of strength of fair or above. The requirements for these levels have been outlined in Table 5-3 in SP800-63A.</p>

<p><strong>Table: Verification Methods and Strengths</strong></p>

<p>Biometrics can play a key role in identity proofing and verification of individuals. This utility can come in multiple stages of the identity proofing process.</p>

<p>In enrollment, agencies can capture biometrics in the form of fingerprints, face, iris images, etc. They can compare requirements with their options to identify which single or multi-modal biometric solution can best respond to their needs and implement the system accordingly.</p>

      <td>While less vulnerable to falisfied evidence, this is still subject to spoofing and other presentation attacks. Inclusion of PAD and image quality requirements can mitigate some of these risks.</td>

      <td>Approach is vulnerable to the user presenting a forged piece of evidence or presentation attacks featuring stolen images of the user or evidence. When instituting agencies should consider additional mitigation measures to help prevent such attacks, including Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), device analytics, and image quality requirements.</td>

      <td>Subject to both human error and technical diffculties. Incoprporation of technology aides, image quality requirements, and training can be leveraged to mitigate these threats. See section 5.3.3.2 for requirements associated with “Supervised Remote In-Person Proofing” events.</td>

      <td>Knowledge Based Verification can be done to link an individual to a fair piece of evidence. However, since IAL2 requires the stronged piece of evidence to be verified, there is limited value in verification of “fair” evidence.</td>
