    <p><strong>Key Stakeholders in the Digital Identity Risk Assessment Process</strong></p>

<p>Robust and effective risk management programs will include input at multiple levels of an agency. Agency leadership, risk management program managers, IT managers, legal teams, and financial analysts can work together to create and maintain a risk management program. The following governance information is not prescriptive, but rather guidance intended to ensure that agencies consider several key players in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>These key players include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Head of Agency</li>
  <li>Chief Information Officer (CIO)</li>
  <li>Chief Financial Officer (CFO)</li>
  <li>Chief Legal Officer/General Counsel</li>
  <li>Chief Communications Officer</li>
  <li>Enterprise Architect</li>
  <li>Information Owner or Steward</li>
  <li>Mission or Business Owner</li>
  <li>Security or Privacy Architect</li>
  <li>Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management</li>
  <li>Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)</li>
  <li>Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)</li>
  <li>System Administrator</li>
  <li>System Owner</li>
  <li>System Security or Privacy Officer</li>
  <li>System User</li>
  <li>Systems Security or Privacy Engineer</li>
  <li>Risk Executive (Function)</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information on the roles and responsibilities of the key participants in the risk assessment process is provided at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>Agency leadership, like the CIO and SAISO, should trust risk management program leaders, such as the SAOP, and information system owners to make informed decisions about the agency's threat landscape and risk management capabilities. Ultimately, the CIO provides final sign-off on risk management decisions, but it is also up to agency leadership to ensure the program is running effectively and has the necessary resources to remain effective.</p>

<p>The SAISO and other risk management program leaders can involve the agency's System Security or Privacy Officer, information system administrators, and information owners/users to gather information about the technical processes and needs of the agency. These conversations are beneficial as a dialogue – the SAISO and other risk management leaders can help others understand potential risks and impacts to the agency – while the SAOP, information system owners, and information owners/users can provide others with knowledge on the practicality and feasibility of technical changes.</p>

<p>As identity risk management decisions affect the entire agency, additional input can be taken into consideration, particularly from agency legal, financial, and privacy experts. Agency General Counsel and legal teams ensure decisions made comply with U.S. law and federal directives. The CFO and other agency financial experts provide an idea of short and long-term costs to the agency in running the program, as well as providing cost estimates of potential negative impacts from adverse events.</p>

<p>The SAOP and the other privacy officers ensure privacy compliance, and maintain a balance between security and privacy requirements, ensuring one is not compromised for the sake of the other. Additionally, risk management program leaders can consider utilizing the agency communications divisions and the Chief Communications Officer to help inform all agency personnel of the agency's pertinent risk management goals and procedures, and how every individual carries responsibility for making the program successful.</p>

<p>Agencies may wish to consider communication methods such as tiger teams or working groups to develop risk management strategies, identify risks, and assess potential risk impacts. These kinds of collaborative sessions enable for input at all levels in an organized manner. Disagreements may persist, however, and issues not resolved through dialogue between technical and program leaders can move to the CIO for broader discussion and resolution. An effective risk management program will flourish with all relevant parties operating as a cohesive, communicative unit.</p>

<p><strong>Key Roles &amp; Responsibilities</strong></p>

<p>The following describes the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in an agency's risk assessment process, in alignment with <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-37/rev-2/draft/documents/sp800-37r2-discussion-draft.pdf">NIST SP 800-37-2</a>. Due to the varying missions, structures, and business functions of agencies, naming conventions for risk management roles may not be uniform across the federal landscape.</p>

<p>Some agencies may also have multiple individuals filling a single role, or one individual filling multiple roles. As such, these roles and responsibilities are intended to be flexible, enabling organizations to effectively accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective organizational structures to best manage security and privacy risks. Many risk management roles defined here have counterpart roles defined in the routine system development life cycle processes carried out by agencies. Whenever possible, agencies can align the risk management roles with similar (or complementary) roles defined for the system development life cycle.</p>

<p><strong>HEAD OF AGENCY</strong></p>

<p>The head of agency is the senior official or chief executive within an organization with the responsibility to provide security protections. These protections should be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation — that is, risk resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; and information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency.* Agency heads or chief executives ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information security management processes are integrated with strategic and operational planning processes;</li>
  <li>Senior officials within the organization provide information security for the information and systems that support the operations and assets under their control; and</li>
  <li>The organization has adequately trained personnel to assist in complying with security requirements in legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, instructions, standards, and guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The head of agency or chief executive establishes the organizational commitment to security and the actions required to effectively manage security risk and protect the missions and business functions being carried out by the organization. They also establish security accountability and provides active support and oversight of monitoring and improvement for the security program. Senior leadership's commitment to security establishes a level of due diligence within the organization that promotes a climate for mission and business success.</p>

<p>* Although the responsibilities of agency heads do not address privacy because they are derived from FISMA, OMB Circular A-130 does require agencies to manage privacy risk throughout the system development life cycle. Therefore, organizations can consider privacy to be a part of these enumerated responsibilities as well.</p>

<p><strong>CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER</strong></p>

<p>The chief information officer is the official responsible for designating a senior agency information security officer; developing and maintaining security policies, procedures, and control techniques to address applicable requirements; overseeing personnel with significant responsibilities for security and ensuring that the personnel are adequately trained; assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security responsibilities; and reporting to the head of the agency on the effectiveness of the organization's security program, including progress of remedial actions.</p>

<p>The chief information officer, with the support of the risk executive (function) and the senior agency information security officer, works closely with authorizing officials and their designated representatives to help ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An organization-wide security program is effectively implemented resulting in adequate security for all organizational systems and environments of operation;</li>
  <li>Security considerations are integrated into programming/planning/budgeting cycles, enterprise architectures, and acquisition/system development life cycles;</li>
  <li>Organizational systems and common controls are covered by approved security plans and possess current authorizations;</li>
  <li>Security-related activities required across the organization are accomplished in an efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner; and</li>
  <li>There is centralized reporting of security-related activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The chief information officer and authorizing officials determine the allocation of resources dedicated to the protection of systems supporting the organization's missions and business functions based on organizational priorities. For selected systems, the chief information officer may be designated as an authorizing official or a co-authorizing official with other senior organizational officials. The role of chief information officer has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.</p>

<p>When an organization has not designated a formal chief information officer position, FISMA requires that the associated responsibilities be handled by a comparable organizational official. For organizations in which the senior agency official for privacy reports to the chief information officer, the chief information officer has equivalent responsibilities for privacy.</p>

<p><strong>CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO)</strong></p>

<p>The senior financial advisor to the Investment Review Board (IRB) and the agency head. Information security investments fall within the purview of the CFO – in this capacity, the CFO is responsible for: reviewing cost goals of each major information security investment; reporting financial management information to OMB as part of the President's budget; complying with legislative and OMB-defined responsibilities as they relate to IT capital investments; reviewing systems that impact financial management activities; and forwarding investment assessments to the IRB.</p>

<p><strong>CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER/GENERAL COUNSEL</strong></p>

<p>The senior official and chief legal officer for an agency, whose responsibilities include providing legal advice and representation to agency leaders and managers, as well as interpreting the laws that govern the expenditure of public funds and the agency's many programs and activities.</p>

<p><strong>CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Chief Communications Officer</em> provides leadership to an agency's public outreach, public education, public disclosure, media relations, and Congressional and legislative affairs functions.</p>

<p><strong>ENTERPRISE ARCHITECT</strong></p>

<p>The enterprise architect is an individual, group, or organization responsible for working with organizational stakeholders, both leadership and subject matter experts, to build a holistic view of the organization's strategy, processes, information, and information technology assets. The role of the enterprise architect is to take this knowledge and ensure that the business and information technology are in alignment.</p>

<p>The enterprise architect links the organizational missions, business functions, strategy, and processes of an organization to its information technology strategy, and documents this using multiple architectural models or views that show how the current and future needs of an organization will be met in an efficient, sustainable, agile, and adaptable manner. Enterprise architects operate across organizational lines to drive common approaches and expose information assets and processes across the enterprise. The objective is to deliver an architecture that supports the most efficient, cost-effective, and secure information technology environment meeting the mission/business needs of the organization.</p>

<p><strong>INFORMATION OWNER OR STEWARD</strong></p>

<p>The information owner/steward is an organizational official with statutory, management, or operational authority for specified information and the responsibility for establishing the policies and procedures governing its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal. In information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is responsible for establishing the rules for appropriate use and protection of the information and retains that responsibility even when the information is shared with or provided to other organizations.</p>

<p>The owner/steward of the information processed, stored, or transmitted by a system may or may not be the same individual as the system owner. An individual system may contain information from multiple information owners/stewards. Information owners/stewards provide input to system owners regarding the security and privacy requirements and security and privacy controls for the systems where the information is processed, stored, or transmitted.</p>

<p><strong>MISSION OR BUSINESS OWNER</strong></p>

<p>The mission or business owner is the senior official or executive within an organization with specific mission or line of business responsibilities and that has a security and privacy interest in the organizational systems supporting those missions or lines of business. Mission or business owners are key stakeholders that have a significant role in defining organizational mission and business processes and the protection needs and security and privacy requirements that ensure the successful conduct of the organization's missions and business operations. This personnel provides essential inputs to the organizational risk management strategy, play an active part in the system development life cycle, and may also serve in the role of authorizing official.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY OR PRIVACY ARCHITECT</strong></p>

<p>The security or privacy architect is an individual, group, or organization responsible for ensuring that the stakeholder security and privacy requirements necessary to protect the organization's mission and business processes are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise architecture including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the systems supporting those missions and business processes.</p>

<p>The security or privacy architect serves as the primary liaison between the enterprise architect and the systems security or privacy engineer and coordinates with system owners, common control providers, and system security or privacy officers on the allocation of security or privacy controls. Security or privacy architects, in coordination with system security or privacy officers, advise authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, and senior accountable officials for risk management/risk executive (function), on a range of security- or privacy-related issues. Examples include establishing system boundaries; assessing the severity of weaknesses and deficiencies in the system; developing effective plans of action and milestones; creating risk mitigation approaches; establishing security or privacy alerts; and potential adverse effects of identified vulnerabilities or privacy risks.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR ACCOUNTABLE OFFICIAL FOR RISK MANAGEMENT</strong></p>

<p>The senior accountable official for risk management* is the individual that leads the risk executive (function) within an organization. The senior accountable official for risk management is the agency head or an individual designated by the agency head.</p>

<p>The risk executive (function) helps to ensure that risk-related considerations for individual systems, to include authorization decisions, are viewed from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the strategic goals and objectives of the organization in carrying out its core missions and business functions; and managing security risk is consistent across the organization, reflects organizational risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risk in order to ensure mission/business success.</p>

<p>The risk executive (function) coordinates with the senior leadership of an organization to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a comprehensive, organization-wide, holistic approach for addressing risk—an approach that provides a greater understanding of the integrated operations of the organization;</li>
  <li>Develop a risk management strategy for the organization providing a strategic view of security-related risks for the organization;**</li>
  <li>Facilitate the sharing of risk-related information among authorizing officials and other senior leaders within the organization;</li>
  <li>Provide oversight for all risk management-related activities across the organization to help ensure consistent and effective risk acceptance decisions;</li>
  <li>Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and business success;</li>
  <li>Provide an organization-wide forum to consider all sources of risk (including aggregated risk) to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;</li>
  <li>Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include authorization actions requiring shared responsibility;</li>
  <li>Ensure that the shared responsibility for supporting organizational mission/business functions using external providers of systems, services, and applications receives the needed visibility and is elevated to the appropriate decision-making authorities; and</li>
  <li>Identify the organizational risk posture based on the aggregated risk from the operation and use of the systems for which the organization is responsible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The senior accountable official for risk management determines the organizational structure and responsibilities of the risk executive (function). The head of the agency, in coordination with the senior accountable official for risk management, may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the function to another official or group. The senior accountable official for risk management and the risk executive (function) have inherent U.S. Government authority and are assigned to government personnel only.</p>

<p>* OMB Memorandum M-17-25 requires the designation of a senior accountable official for risk management. Although M-17-25 enumerates responsibilities specific to information security, OMB Circular A-123, Management's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control, requires agencies to consider privacy risk among other risks. Organizations have the discretion to add privacy to the responsibilities of the senior accountable official for risk management if it would support greater consideration of privacy risk in the enterprise risk management process.</p>

<p>** Authorizing officials may have narrow or localized perspectives in rendering authorization decisions without fully understanding or explicitly accepting the organization-wide risks being incurred from such decisions.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR AGENCY INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER (SAISO)</strong></p>

<p>The senior agency information security officer is an organizational official responsible for carrying out the chief information officer security responsibilities under FISMA, and serving as the primary liaison for the chief information officer to the organization's authorizing officials, system owners, common control providers, and system security officers.</p>

<p>The senior agency information security officer is also responsible for coordinating with the senior agency official for privacy to ensure coordination between privacy and information security programs. The senior agency information security officer possesses the professional qualifications, including training and experience, required to administer security program functions; maintains security duties as a primary responsibility; and heads an office with the specific mission and resources to assist the organization in achieve trustworthy, secure information and systems in accordance with the requirements in FISMA.</p>

<p>The senior agency information security officer may serve as authorizing official designated representative or as a security control assessor. The role of senior agency information security officer has inherent U.S. Government authority and is therefore assigned to government personnel only. Organizations may also refer to the senior agency information security officer as the senior information security officer or chief information security officer.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR AGENCY OFFICIAL FOR PRIVACY (SAOP)</strong></p>

<p>The senior agency official for privacy is a senior official or executive with agency-wide responsibility and accountability for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risk.</p>

<p>The senior agency official for privacy is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coordinating with the senior information security officer to ensure coordination of privacy and information security activities;</li>
  <li>Ensuring the privacy program plan addresses the privacy controls in place or planned for meeting applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risk;</li>
  <li>Reviewing and approving the categorization of systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable information;</li>
  <li>Designating which controls will be treated as program management, common, system-specific, and hybrid privacy controls;</li>
  <li>Identifying assessment methods to determine if privacy controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and sufficient to ensure privacy requirements and privacy risks are addressed;</li>
  <li>Reviewing and approving privacy plans for systems prior to authorization, reauthorization, or ongoing authorization; reviewing authorization information for systems that create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, disclose, or dispose of personally identifiable information to ensure privacy requirements and privacy risks have been addressed; and</li>
  <li>Developing and maintaining a privacy continuous monitoring program to maintain ongoing awareness of privacy risks and assess privacy controls at a frequency sufficient to ensure privacy requirements and privacy risks have been addressed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR</strong></p>

<p>The system administrator is an individual, group, or organization responsible for setting up and maintaining a system or specific components of a system. System administrator responsibilities include, for example, installing, configuring, and updating hardware and software; establishing and managing user accounts; overseeing or conducting backup and recovery tasks; implementing operational and technical security and privacy controls; and adhering to organizational security and privacy policies and procedures.</p>

<p><strong>SYSTEM OWNER</strong></p>

<p>The system owner is an organizational official responsible for the procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and disposal of an organizational system. The system owner is responsible for addressing the operational interests of the user community (i.e., users who require access to the system to satisfy mission, business, or operational requirements) and for ensuring compliance with security requirements.</p>

<p>In coordination with the system security and privacy officers, the system owner is responsible for the development and maintenance of the security and privacy plans and ensures that the system is deployed and operated in accordance with the selected and implemented security and privacy controls. They are also responsible for deciding who has access to the system (and with what types of privileges or access rights)* and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security and privacy training.</p>

<p>Based on guidance from the authorizing official, the system owner informs organizational officials of the need to conduct the authorization, ensures that the necessary resources are available for the effort, and provides the required system access, information, and documentation to control assessors. The system owner receives the security and privacy assessment results from the control assessors. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities or privacy risks, the system owner assembles the authorization package and submits the package to the authorizing official or the authorizing official designated representative for adjudication. The authorizing official may choose to designate an individual other than the system owner to compile and assemble the information for the authorization package. In this situation, the designated individual coordinates the compilation and assembly activities with the system owner.</p>

<p>The system owner serves as the focal point for the organizational system. In that capacity, the system owner serves as the central point of contact between the authorization process and the owners of components of the system including, for example: applications, networking, servers, or workstations; owners/stewards of information processed, stored, or transmitted by the system; and owners of the missions and business functions supported by the system. Organizations may refer to system owners as program managers or business/asset owners.</p>

<p>* The responsibility for deciding who has access to specific information within an organizational system (and with what types of privileges or access rights) may reside with the information owner/steward.</p>

<p><strong>SYSTEM SECURITY OR PRIVACY OFFICER</strong></p>

<p>The system security or privacy officer is an individual responsible for ensuring that the operational security and privacy posture is maintained for an organizational system and as such, works in close collaboration with the system owner. The system security or privacy officer also serves as a principal advisor on all matters, technical and otherwise, involving the security or privacy controls for the system.</p>

<p>The system security or privacy officer has the knowledge and expertise to manage the security or privacy aspects of an organizational system and, in many organizations, is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day system security or privacy operations. This responsibility may also include, but is not limited to, physical and environmental protection; personnel security; incident handling; and security and privacy training and awareness.</p>

<p>The system security or privacy officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the security or privacy policies and procedures and to ensure compliance with those policies and procedures. In close coordination with the system owner, the system security or privacy officer often plays an active role in the monitoring of a system and its environment of operation to include developing and updating security and privacy plans, managing and controlling changes to the system, and assessing the security or privacy impact of those changes.</p>

<p>Organizations may define a system security manager or security manager role with similar responsibilities as a system security officer or with oversight responsibilities for a security program. In these situations, system security officers may, at the discretion of the organization, report directly to system security managers or security managers. Organizations may assign equivalent responsibilities for privacy to separate individuals with appropriate subject matter expertise.</p>

<p><strong>SYSTEM USER</strong></p>

<p>The system user is an individual or (system) process acting on behalf of an individual that is authorized to access organizational information and systems to perform assigned duties. System user responsibilities include, but are not limited to, adhering to organizational policies that govern acceptable use of organizational systems; using the organization-provided information technology resources for defined purposes only; and reporting anomalous or suspicious system behavior.</p>

<p><strong>SYSTEMS SECURITY OR PRIVACY ENGINEER</strong></p>

<p>The systems security or privacy engineer is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting systems security or privacy engineering activities as part of the system development life cycle. Systems security and privacy engineering is a process that captures and refines security or privacy requirements and ensures that the requirements are effectively integrated into the component products and systems through purposeful security or privacy architecting, design, development, and configuration.</p>

<p>Systems security or privacy engineers are an integral part of the development team—designing and developing organizational systems or upgrading existing systems. These personnel employ best practices when implementing security or privacy controls within a system including software engineering methodologies; system and security or privacy engineering principles; secure or privacy-enhancing design, secure or privacy-enhancing architecture, and secure or privacy-enhancing coding techniques.</p>

<p>Systems security or privacy engineers coordinate security- and privacy-related activities with senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, system owners, common control providers, and system security or privacy officers.</p>

<p><strong>RISK EXECUTIVE (FUNCTION)</strong></p>

<p>The risk executive (function) is an individual or group within an organization that provides a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to risk management. The risk executive (function) serves as the common risk management resource for senior leaders/executives, mission/business owners, chief information officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, system owners, common control providers, enterprise architects, security architects, systems security or privacy engineers, system security or privacy managers/officers, and any other stakeholders having a vested interest in the mission/business success of organizations. The risk executive (function) coordinates with senior leaders and executives to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establish risk management roles and responsibilities;</li>
  <li>Develop and implement an organization-wide risk management strategy that guides and informs organizational risk decisions (including how risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and monitored over time);</li>
  <li>Manage threat, vulnerability, and security/privacy risk information for organizational systems and the environments in which the systems operate;</li>
  <li>Establish organization-wide forums to consider all types and sources of risk (including aggregated risk);</li>
  <li>Determine organizational risk based on the aggregated risk from the operation and use of systems and the respective environments of operation;</li>
  <li>Provide oversight for the risk management activities carried out by organizations to ensure consistent and effective risk-based decisions;</li>
  <li>Develop a broad-based understanding of risk regarding the strategic view of organizations and their integrated operations;</li>
  <li>Establish effective vehicles and serve as a focal point for communicating and sharing risk related information among key stakeholders internally and externally to organizations;</li>
  <li>Specify the degree of autonomy for subordinate organizations permitted by parent organizations regarding framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk;</li>
  <li>Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include authorization actions requiring shared responsibility (e.g., joint/leveraged authorizations);</li>
  <li>Ensure that authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and business success; and</li>
  <li>Ensure shared responsibility for supporting organizational missions and business functions using external providers receives the needed visibility and is elevated to appropriate decision-making authorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The risk executive (function) presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization. Heads of agencies or organizations may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the function. The risk executive (function) requires a mix of skills, expertise, and perspectives to understand the strategic goals and objectives of organizations, organizational missions/business functions, technical possibilities and constraints, and key mandates and guidance that shape organizational operations.</p>

<p>To provide this needed mixture, the risk executive (function) can be filled by a single individual or office (supported by an expert staff) or by a designated group (e.g., a risk board, executive steering committee, executive leadership council). The risk executive (function) fits into the organizational governance structure in such a way as to facilitate efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
