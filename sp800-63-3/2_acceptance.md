**Digital Identity Risk Acceptance Statement Template**

Agencies providing digital identity services shall codify their risk decisions in a Digital Identity Acceptance Statement, in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-3 and NIST SP 800-53 IA-1(a)(2)[1]. The former SP details how to manage identity and authentication risks via identity-related controls, but references the latter SP as needed for security controls.
In accordance with SP 800-63-3, a Digital Identity Acceptance Statement shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
1.	Assessed Assurance Level(s),
2.	Implemented Assurance Level(s),
3.	Rationale, if implemented Assurance Level(s) differs from assessed Assurance Level(s),
4.	Comparability demonstration of compensating controls when the complete set of applicable 800-63 requirements are not implemented, and
5.	If not accepting federated identities, rationale.


Additional information included in the statement is up to individual agency discretion.
