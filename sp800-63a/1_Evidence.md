Identity evidence comprises physical or digital artifacts used by a subscriber to prove the real-world existence of a claimed identity. Evidence required by the agency and provided by the applicant must contain features that enable the agency to resolve the identity and support both validation (confirmed to be genuine and accurate) and verification (demonstrated to associated with the subscriber) at the appropriate strengths for a defined use case.

It is ultimately up to the agency to determine which biographic information to collect about an applicant to meet identity resolution needs. The degree of confidence with which evidence is resolved into a single identity also needs to be determined by the agency considering their risk appetite. The goal of identity resolution should be to have a sufficient level of confidence instead of achieving 100 percent probabilistic certainty. Caution should be taken in collecting, utilizing, and storing a minimally required set of attributes. Furthermore, in accordance with requirements in 800-63A, notice must be provided to users about what information is collected, why it is collected, and what will be done with it.

Sets and combinations of core and supplemental attributes provide varying levels of effectiveness, sensitivity, availability and reliability. An assessment of such metrics for core and supplemental identity attributes, e.g. name, address, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name and gender, can be found in NASPO-IDPV-60 by the American Security Products Organization’s Identity Proofing and Verification (IDPV) working group (NASPO-IDPV-60. Establishment of Core Identity Attribute Sets and Supplemental Identity Attributes, Report of the IDPV Identity Resolution Project, Feb. 17, 2014). The analysis conducted in this study provides interesting results in terms of the effectiveness of combining attributes for resolution and also shows that there are diminishing returns to increasing the number of core attributes collected from applicants, as evidenced in the following table. Organizations that seek a balance between the effectiveness of resolution and an increasing list of collected attributes can review such studies for information. Its inclusion here is not intended to endorse the IDPV standard, but instead illustrate how attribute sets may be balanced or combined to support resolution.

The evidence contains a reference number, full name, and image (photo) for verification. It includes digital information and physical security features which can be validated, such as a watermark, microprint, optically variable ink, and an RFID chip. Many passports also contain a captured biometric which can be used for biometric verification if needed, including an image of the photograph of the passport holder, and fingerprint and iris scan templates.  | Under current criteria, passports could be considered as low as Fair, since they can be issued via the mail. Although passports are capable of storing biometric templates, not all passports have biometric templates on them. However, the recommendation is to consider passports Superior evidence. |
| Permanent Resident Card (Issued On or After May 11, 2010) | Superior | Permanent Resident Cards issued on or after May 11, 2010 are considered Superior evidence because because the issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services green card issuance policies.

They only prove that the person named on the card holds the unique reference number identified on the card. | Although it meets the criteria for Fair, it is being recommended as a Weak evidence type. It is not an identity document, but rather a bridge/eligibility document.  |
| Original or certified copy of a birth certificate issued by a state, county, municipal authority or outlying possession of the United States bearing an official seal | Weak | U.S. Birth Certificates are considered Weak evidence because the issuing source did not perform identity proofing. The issuing process means it can be reasonably assumed it was delivered into possession of the person or parent/guardian. The evidence contains a reference number and full name.
